## Projects:

<div class="card">
  <h3>National Vehicle Crashes & Daylight Savings Time</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Investigated whether the Spring transition to daylight savings time has an impact on fatal car crashes in the United States.</li>
    <li>Addressed and accounted for potential confounding variables.</li>
    <li>Compared national data to state-specific data where daylight savings time does not occur.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Bacteria Growth & Survival Modeling Using Cellular Automata</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Used cellular automata to model bacteria in a competitive environment with limited resources.</li>
    <li>Measured complexity of the system as a metric for suvival/death behavior.</li>
    <li>Explored the differences between stochastic and deterministic versions of the system.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Spam Classification Using a Novel Method: Signed Rank-Turbulence Divergence</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Applied a signed version of rank-turbulence divergence (Dodds et al.) as a method for classifying spam e-mails.</li>
    <li>Wrote scripts to clean e-mail data to allow for classification.</li>
    <li>Evaluated the performance of this method compared to the state-of-the-art.</li>
  </ul>

<div class="card">
  <h3>A Comparison of Training Neural Networks Using Evolutionary Algorithms versus Gradient Descent.</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Implemented stochastic gradient descent with momentum and evolutionary algorithms as methods for training neural networks for character classification on the MNIST dataset.</li>
    <li>Used parameter optimization to create the best results for both methods.</li>
    <li>Evaluated the performance of each method pertaining to time-to-convergence and network accuracy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Library Management System Database in PL/SQL</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Created conceptual and relational schemas that represent and organize a library management system database.</li>
    <li>Implemented the system using PL/SQL that handles resources, check-outs, due dates, event programming, etc.</li>
  </ul>
