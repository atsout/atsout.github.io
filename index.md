## About Me:

I'm Adeline, a Data Science Masters graduate, searching for my first post-graduate job.

I majored in Biology as an undergraduate at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. In addition to my studies, I worked in the Electron Microscopy Core Facility where I participated in research that utilized both transmission and scanning electron microscopy. This work involved sample preparation, operation of the equipment and software, and ultimately development of image analysis software.

My experience at the lab, particularly developing software tools to automate identification of features in the image data (eliminating a tedious manual process), led me to become interested in Data Science. I went on to pursue a Masters in Complex Systems & Data Science at the University of Vermont with a goal of leveraging data science techniques to extract meaning from data.

Throughout the course of my work and studies, I have gained hands-on skills (eg. sample preparation and scanning electron microscope operation), software skills (eg. ImageJ), and programming skills (eg. Python, C++ and R). A sampling of the projects that I have worked on are described [here](./projects).

I'm passionate about combining my interest in biological sciences, laboratory experience, and data science skills to make a valuable impact.
