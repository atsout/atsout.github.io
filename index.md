## About Me:

I'm Adeline, a recent data science MS graduate!

I studied biology as an undergraduate at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and, while working with electron microscopy data, I became interested in data science for the purposes of image analysis. I then pursued an MS in Complex Systems & Data Science at the University of Vermont. Given these combined interests, my main interest is to continue to leverage data science methods to analyze biological data in meaningful ways in my work.

Throughout the course of my work and studies, I have developed skills in C++, Python, and R as well as software like ImageJ. I also have experience in the laboratory with sample preparation and electron microscopy. In my MS program, I had the opportunity to work on many projects (which can be found [here](./projects)) with practical applications that gave me experience with data analysis and visualization, machine learning, and neural networks.

I'm passionate about combining my laboratory background and computer science skills to make a difference in the world.
